-Chainsaw fix. Removes AudioComponent from chainsaw, preventing it from filling up memory.

-Perk list fix. Makes Oil Blood, Gas Blood, Electricity and Explosive Corpses remove the related immunities from the pool like they were supposed to

-Mortal Kolmi. Fixes two bugs that could make the final boss unkillable. (Thanks Extol)

-Nightmare fix. Ensures that in nightmare mode the spreading sidebiomes do not overwrite Orb Rooms, Boss Arena or the Work.

-Friend fix. Makes Friend actually get buffs from horror monster kills.

-Spells to Power fix. Minimum particle amount is now 0. Negative particle amounts causes Noita to freeze and crash, which tentacle spells can cause.

-Runestone fix. Item pedestals could only spawn Runestone of Edges. Now all of them spawn like they were intended.

-Always cast perk fix. The Always Cast perk could not give Modifiers, Static Projectiles or Utility spells due to missing enums. Now it can.

-Sunstone fix. Sunseed and sunstone items can no longer be deleted during NG+ entry.

-Ice mage fix. They now correctly spawn in frozen vault.

-Copy Three Random Spells fix. This spell didn't always create 3 copies like promised, because of draw in the middle of the cast. It now gets 3 random spells first and then calls them.

-Ruby fix. A cosmetic reward wasn't being awarded reliably, it should work better now.

-Crystal key fix. Fixed an issue where losing a crystal key that had listened to a music machine would lock you out of the quest.

-Fungal shifting quality of life. Dark cave next to mines now spawns some green fungus so you can always do shifting.

-Explosive detonator fix. Explosive detonator had an error causing it to sometimes fail.

-Perk loading fix. Due to the perk altar spawning inbetween two chunks, players could sometimes lose one or more perks due to restarting/crashing. No longer happens.

-HM statue quality of life. Statues can no longer die, letting you test damage on them as much as you like.

-Sun Crystal fix. The crystals that spawn on the scale easily lose the entity tied to them. The floating island now also spawns material checkers in case the entity is gone.
